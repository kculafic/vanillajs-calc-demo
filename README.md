# vanillajs-calc-demo

This project is a quick sandbox to make a simple savings projection based on 3 params (Number of Years, Interest rate, and Input amount). Using vanilla javascript / simple DOM manipulation to render mathematical output.

stretch tasks / to refactor:
* change param storage to add capacity for more projections
* refactor input constraints (to not have to manually click `save`)
* refactor visual render to correct numbers, nix table structure for better aesthetics
